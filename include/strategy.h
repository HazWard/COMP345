/** Strategy Summary (PLEASE READ THIS!)
 * The Strategy class encapsulates the behaviors of Players. The general idea behind the strategy is that each
 * game phase requires the Player's instance to perform the actions and when each phase returns a Response object
 * contain the changes that occurred during the phase. The Game has the responsibility of interpreting the Response
 * and performing the concrete actions required on the game map. This ensures that the Game has knowledge of everything
 * that happens but also makes sure that it has complete control over the changes that occur throughout the game.
